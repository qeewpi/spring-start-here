## Spring Start Here

### About

This repository was created to track my progress for the "Spring Start Here" book, as well as compare my written exercise solutions to the source code written by the author.

### Background

I picked up this book as I felt overwhelmed by the requirements of an idea for an app I recently had fleshed out.

While I have been able to implement the Spring framework for a project in the past, I recognize that I have yet to gain better understanding of the fundamentals.

My hopes are that this book will aid me in tackling my project.
