## Spring Start Here

### About

This repository was created to track my progress for the "Spring Start Here" book, as well as to compare my written exercise solutions to the source code written by the author.

### Background

I picked up this book as I felt overwhelmed by the requirements of an app idea I recently fleshed out.

While I have been able to implement the Spring framework for a project in the past, I recognize that I have yet to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals.

My hope is that this book will aid me in tackling my project and, overall, improve my fundamental knowledge of Spring.
